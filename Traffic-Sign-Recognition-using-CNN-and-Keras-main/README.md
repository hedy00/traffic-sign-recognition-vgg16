# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-using-CNN-and-Keras
Using a 30,000-image dataset, we developed a CNN with Keras for traffic sign classification, and in 15 epochs, we achieved 98.3% accuracy. Tkinter GUI was implemented to allow for interactive picture classification, demonstrating proficiency with deep learning and model deployment.
